# Predictive-Modeling---Big-Data-Insights-on-Smoking-and-Drinking-Habits

##Intorduction
Unveiling the true Power of Big Data represents a pioneering effort in Big Data Analytics, aiming to reshape
healthcare sector, specifically in addressing the impacts of alcohol consumption and smoking. By leveraging
predictive analytics, the project seeks to predict the likelihood of individuals adopting these habits. Focused
on unraveling the underlying determinants, including personal life, as well as physiological indicators such as
height, weight, hemoglobin, gender, urine creatine, and other 24 features, the interdisciplinary team strives
to proactively intervene. This proactive approach aims to prevent the initiation of harmful behaviors by
examining how these factors are influenced by unhealthy lifestyle choices. The research extends its
predictive modeling to assess current smoking behavior, past history, or non-smoking status, incorporating
lifestyle indicators and health metrics for comprehensive insights.
Beyond its implications for healthcare, project holds potential benefits for health management organizatins,
gyms, and charities dedicated to combating smoking and drinking issues. The project's predictive insights
offer employers cost savings on health insurance, aid gyms in optimizing health routines, and support
charities in enhancing their interventions. Emphasizing a holistic approach, the project goes beyond statistical
analysis, positioning itself as a trailblazer in predictive healthcare. By laying the foundation for a
transformative paradigm, the research aims to instigate a proactive, preventative healthcare approach,
offering individuals a second chance and contributing to a healthier and more informed society.

##Project Goal
The overarching objective of this research project is to construct a robust predictive model capable of
accurately classifying individuals into distinct categories based on their smoking habits and alcohol
consumption patterns. This advanced model not only classifies individuals as abstainers, current smokers,
or former smokers but also forecasts their likelihood of engaging in alcohol consumption. Through a
meticulous analysis of the intricate interplay between these critical lifestyle choices, our aim is to unveil
underlying patterns and trends that significantly influence individual behavior. The invaluable insights derived
from this project will play a pivotal role in shaping targeted health interventions, facilitating tailored awareness
campaigns, and devising personalized healthcare strategies. Furthermore, the developed model stands to
benefit insurance companies and health management organizations by furnishing crucial insights into
individual health risks and predicting potential healthcare costs, thereby contributing to more informed
decision-making in the realm of public health.
